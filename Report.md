## TITLE:

  Grid Games 

## DESCRIPTION:

 Grid Games is a browser-based math game best played on an iOS device with VoiceOver. It  includes a hundreds chart with the ability to change how many rows and columns in order for users to understand how number charts work. It also includes two games: find the missing number and complete the table. In Find the Missing Number game, one number in the hundreds chart is missing and they must find out what number it is. In the Complete the Table game, two, three, or four numbers are missing (around a central number) and the user must figure out all of them.

## INTENDED AUDIENCE:

  Grid Games is intended for young blind children who are learning their numbers and how to count by tens. It can also be used by visual children as well, but intended for visually impaired and blind children. 

## TECHNOLOGIES, FRAMEWORKS, LIBRARIES:

  We created Grid Games using React JS. We also incorporated some elements from React Bootstrap for style. We used npm from Node to manage and run the code. As stated in the description, this game is meant to be used in conjunction with iOS’s VoiceOver

## HOW TO BUILD AND DEPLOY: 

  To build, we called npm build, then copied that over to a branch called gh-pages and deleted everything except the contents of the build folder. Then, we used GitHub to call GitHub Pages from the gh-pages branch.

## PROBLEMS ENCOUNTERED:

  VoiceOver doesn’t appear to work exactly the same on all devices (different updates, versions, etc.), so compatibility with that is sometimes difficult. 

## FUTURE WORK: 

  In the future, developers could look into touch events to have a gesture jump to the missing number, so the user doesn’t have to swipe through the entire chart to get to it. Future development can also gamify it a bit more by adding a storyline, such as an animal stole the number and the user must get it back. It could also incorporate more games, such as find a missing number and one more than it, missing number and ten more than it, the possibilies are endless!
