# Instructions
This project is a math game geared towards blind children who are learning their numbers. These games are played best on an iOS device using VoiceOver set on tables. Our game includes several features such as “Table”, “Missing Number Game” and a “Complete the Table Game”. 
## Table
“Table” allows blind children to swipe through the 100 Grid in order to get their bearings and be able to spatially gain familiarity with the number grid. The user can also change the amount of rows and columns to be able to master other grid sizes. 
## Missing Number Game
“Missing Number Game” is a game where the user needs to travel through the grid to find the missing number. They then need to click on the missing number and input what number they think belongs. The game will tell the user if they guess correctly or incorrectly and need to try again. 
## Complete the Table Game
In the “Complete the Table Game”, the user needs to travel through the grid to find the missing numbers. Depending on where the missing numbers are located there could be 2-4 missing numbers that need to be guessed. They need to click on the missing numbers and input their guesses to what number belongs in that box. The game will tell the user if they guess correctly or incorrectly and need to try again.
